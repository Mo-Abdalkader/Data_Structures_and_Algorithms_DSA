# Stack Data Structure

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top. The operations on a stack are typically performed at one end, known as the "top" of the stack.

## Functionalities

1. **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop:** Removes the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek or Top:** Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty:** Checks if the stack is empty.
5. **Size:** Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Time and Space Complexity

1. **Push:** O(1) - Constant time complexity. The push operation involves adding an element to the top of the stack, and this operation takes the same amount of time, regardless of the size of the stack.

2. **Pop:** O(1) - Constant time complexity. The pop operation involves removing the element from the top of the stack, and like push, it takes constant time.

3. **Peek or Top:** O(1) - Constant time complexity. Accessing the element at the top of the stack is a simple operation that takes constant time.

4. **IsEmpty:** O(1) - Constant time complexity. Checking if the stack is empty involves a simple comparison,

[Additional points and considerations]

### Additional Considerations

1. **Applications:**
   - **Function Calls:** The call stack is used to manage function calls in most programming languages.
   - **Expression Evaluation:** Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, especially in converting infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation.
   - **Undo Mechanisms:** Stacks can be used to implement undo functionality in applications.

2. **Dynamic Arrays vs. Linked Lists:**
   - Stacks can be implemented using dynamic arrays or linked lists. Dynamic arrays are more space-efficient, but their size may need to be resized, leading to occasional O(n) time complexity for push operation. Linked lists avoid resizing, but each element requires additional memory for the link.

3. **Overflow and Underflow:**
   - **Overflow:** Occurs when trying to push an element onto a full stack.
   - **Underflow:** Occurs when trying to pop or peek from an empty stack.

4. **Reversing a Sequence:**
   - Stacks can be used to reverse a sequence of elements. By pushing elements onto a stack and then popping them, the order is reversed.

5. **Limitations:**
   - Stacks have limited random access. You can only directly access the top element.
   - For applications requiring access to arbitrary elements, other data structures like arrays may be more suitable.

6. **Languages and Libraries:**
   - Many programming languages have built-in support for stacks. For example, in Python, you can use lists as stacks. Similarly, many standard libraries provide stack implementations.

7. **Balanced Parentheses:**
   - Stacks are commonly used to check whether parentheses, brackets, and braces are balanced in an expression.

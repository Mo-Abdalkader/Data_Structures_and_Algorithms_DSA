# Recursion VS Tail Recursion

1. **Execution Order:**
   - **Recursion:** In recursion, after the recursive call, there might be additional operations that need to be performed (e.g., combining results or additional calculations).
   - **Tail Recursion:** The recursive call is the last operation, and no further computations are needed after it.

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - **Recursion:** Each recursive call typically adds a new stack frame, potentially leading to stack overflow for deep recursions.
   - **Tail Recursion:** Can be optimized to reuse the same stack frame, thus saving memory and avoiding stack overflow.

3. **Optimization:**
   - **Recursion:** Generally requires more memory and might not be optimized by all compilers or interpreters.
   - **Tail Recursion:** Can be optimized into an iterative form by compilers or interpreters that support tail call optimization.

4. **Use Cases:**
   - **Recursion:** Useful for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems, often involving tree structures (like traversals or tree transformations).
   - **Tail Recursion:** Particularly beneficial when efficiency and memory usage are concerns, especially in functional programming languages that emphasize recursion.

## Introduction

Jump Search is an algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by jumping ahead by fixed steps and then performing a linear search within the identified block. Jump Search is particularly useful for large datasets where a linear search would be too slow.

## Key Concepts

1. **Definition**: Jump Search divides the array into blocks of fixed size and jumps ahead by these block sizes until the block containing the target element is found.
2. **Time Complexity**: 
   - **Best Case**: \(O(1)\) - when the target is found in the first block.
   - **Average Case**: \(O(sqrt{n})\) - due to the block size being the square root of the array length.
   - **Worst Case**: \(O(sqrt{n})\) - when the target is at the end of the array.
3. **Space Complexity**: 
   - \(O(1)\) - uses a constant amount of additional space.
4. **Applicability**: Requires the collection to be sorted. Commonly used for searching in arrays and lists.

## How It Works

1. Calculate the optimal jump step size as the square root of the array length.
2. Start from the beginning of the array and jump ahead by the calculated step size until an element greater than or equal to the target is found.
3. Perform a linear search within the identified block to find the exact position of the target element.

## Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Faster than linear search for large datasets.
- Simple to implement and understand.

**Cons:**
- Requires the collection to be sorted.
- Not as fast as Binary Search for very large datasets.

    public int jumpSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int step = (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
        int prev = 0;

        // Finding the block where the element is present (if it is present)
        while (arr[Math.min(step, n) - 1] < target) {
            prev = step;
            step += (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
            if (prev >= n) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        // Doing a linear search for target in the block beginning with prev
        while (arr[prev] < target) {
            prev++;
            // If we reach the next block or end of the array, element is not present
            if (prev == Math.min(step, n)) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        // If element is found
        if (arr[prev] == target) {
            return prev;
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JumpSearch js = new JumpSearch();
        int[] arr = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610};
        int target = 55;
        int index = js.jumpSearch(arr, target);
        System.out.println("Element " + target + " is at index: " + index);
    }
}
```
#### Output : 
```markdown
Element 55 is at index: 10
```

## Summary
Jump Search is a useful algorithm for searching elements in a sorted array. It balances simplicity and efficiency, providing a good alternative to linear search with better time complexity. While not as fast as Binary Search, it still offers significant performance improvements for large datasets.

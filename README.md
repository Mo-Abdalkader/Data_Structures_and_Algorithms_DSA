# Data Structures

**Definition:**
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory so that it can be used efficiently.

**Purpose:**
Data structures are used to manage and organize data in a way that supports various operations, such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

## Types of Data Structures:

- **Primitive Data Structures:** Basic data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.
- **Linear Data Structures:** Elements are arranged in a linear sequence, e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Non-linear Data Structures:** Elements are not arranged in a sequential manner, e.g., trees and graphs.
- **Homogeneous Data Structures:** All elements are of the same type, e.g., arrays.
- **Heterogeneous Data Structures:** Elements can be of different types, e.g., structures and objects.

## Operations on Data Structures:

- **Traversal:** Accessing and processing each element in a data structure.
- **Search:** Finding the location of a particular element.
- **Insertion:** Adding a new element to the data structure.
- **Deletion:** Removing an element from the data structure.
- **Sorting:** Arranging elements in a specific order.
- **Merging:** Combining two or more data structures into one.

## Simple Data Structures:

- **Arrays:** Basic collection of elements in contiguous memory.
- **Linked Lists:** Elements connected by pointers in a linear structure.
- **Stacks:** Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Queues:** First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Sets:** Collection of distinct elements with no specific order.
- **Hash Maps:** Mapping keys to values using a hash function.

## Intermediate Data Structures:

- **Trees:**
  - **Binary Tree:** Hierarchical structure with nodes having at most two children.
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Ordered binary tree for efficient search.
  - **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree.
- **Graphs:**
  - **Directed Graph and Undirected Graph:** Collections of vertices and edges.
  - **Graph Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List:** Representations of graphs.
- **Heaps:**
  - **Min Heap and Max Heap:** Binary heaps with specific ordering properties.
- **Trie:** Tree structure for storing dynamic sets or associative arrays.
- **Disjoint Set (Union-Find):** Data structure for partitioning elements into disjoint subsets.

## Complex Data Structures:

- **Hash Tables:** Efficient data structure for key-value mapping.
- **B-trees and B+ Trees:** Self-balancing trees used in databases and file systems.
- **Skip List:** Structure allowing quick search, insertion, and deletion in a sorted sequence.
- **Priority Queue:** Abstract data type with constant-time access to the highest (or lowest) priority element.
- **Sparse Matrix:** Data structure for representing matrices with mostly zero elements.
- **Quadtree and Octree:** Trees partitioning space in two and three dimensions, respectively.
- **Self-Balancing Trees:**
  - **Red-Black Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree.
  - **Splay Tree:** Binary search tree with a restructuring property.
- **Cuckoo Hashing:** Hash table algorithm resolving collisions using multiple hash functions.

# Data Structures:

## Definition: 
Data structures refer to the way data is organized, stored, and managed in a computer's memory.
## Purpose: 
They provide a means to store and organize data efficiently to facilitate operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
## Examples: 
Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.
## Focus: 
Concerned with the implementation and organization of data to optimize storage and access.

# Algorithms:

## Definition: 
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
## Purpose: 
They define how data structures are manipulated and processed to produce a desired output.
## Examples: 
Sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), etc.
## Focus: 
Concerned with the methodology or approach to solving problems efficiently using computational steps.

# Key Difference:
## Nature: 
Data structures focus on organizing and managing data efficiently in memory.
## Function: 
Algorithms focus on defining computational procedures to manipulate and process that data to achieve specific tasks or outcomes.
